## About the Project

**Mapty** is a web application that combines maps and activity logging to create a fun and interactive experience. 

### Features
- Click anywhere on the map to add a location-based activity (e.g., cycling, running).
- A form appears on the left panel to log details such as distance, duration, and more.
- Once saved:
  - A marker is added to the map at the clicked location.
  - The activity log is displayed in the left panel.
- Data is stored in **local storage**, ensuring that:
  - Entries remain even after refreshing the page.
  - Activities can be deleted individually or all at once using the **Delete** or **Delete All** buttons.

### My Contribution
This project was created by following the JavaScript course by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). While the core functionality and design were provided in the course, I extended it by implementing:
- A **Delete** button to remove individual activity logs.
- A **Delete All** button to clear all activities from the map and the log.

> **Note:** The HTML and CSS files were pre-written as part of the course.
